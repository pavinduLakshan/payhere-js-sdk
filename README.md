# payhere-js-sdk
JavaScript SDKs for payhere.lk for Browser and Node.js

Payhere, one of the most popular payment gateways in Sri Lanka, lacks a developer-friendly integration with modern front-end JS frameworks like React.js, Angular.js, and Vue.js etc. But worry not! We have developed an NPM package specifically designed to effortlessly integrate Payhere into your single-page web app, ensuring a seamless user experience.

Have a look at the [samples](/samples) to get an idea of how to use the packages

## Features

- Works in front end JS frameworks
- Making one time payments with Checkout API
- Making Recurrent payments with Recurring API (monthly, daily. annually)
- Get payments data of your Payhere account using Retrieval API
- Linking customers payment info with your app for making future payments at any time without customer intervention
- subscriptions management (Find, retry and cancel subscriptions)

## How to use

This repository hosts code for two NPM packages.
